\section{Overview}
During my years in government, academia and the corporate world, I have explored various themes related to the numerical simulation of high-resolution, multi-disciplinary and multiphysics applications in modern high-performance computing environments.
To achieve accurate numerical models with overnight runtime, I have focused on high-order mesh generation and adaptation for increased resolution at a lower computational cost.
