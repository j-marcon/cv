\section{Overview}
Rocket scientist by training, software engineer by trade, I have followed a diverse career path, leading me to work in academia, government and the corporate world, both in Europe and in the USA.
My early years have focused on the adaptive numerical simulation of aerospace systems in modern computing environments.
More recently, I have transitioned to the robotics industry, seeking new challenges and expanding my skill set in the areas of algorithm development and operations research with emphasis on the optimisation of complex systems.
