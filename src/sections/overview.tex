\section{Overview}
Rocket scientist by training, software engineer by trade, I have followed a seemingly diverse career path.
I have accumulated 7 years of experience in software development solving complex problems in academia, government and the corporate world, in both Europe and the United States.
My early years were focused on the adaptive numerical simulation of aerospace systems in modern computing environments.
More recently, I have been seeking new challenges and expanding my skill set to the areas of algorithm development and operations research with emphasis on the optimisation of complex robotic systems.
