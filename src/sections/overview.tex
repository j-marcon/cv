\section{Overview}
Rocket scientist by training, software engineer by trade, I have followed a seemingly diverse career path, focused on solving complex problems.
I have worked in academia, government and the corporate world, both in Europe and in the USA, and accumulated over 7 years of experience in software development.
My early years have focused on the adaptive numerical simulation of aerospace systems in modern computing environments.
More recently, I have been seeking new challenges and expanding my skill set in the areas of algorithm development and operations research with emphasis on the optimisation of complex robotic systems.
